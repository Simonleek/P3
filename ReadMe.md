P3: Laravel Basics
The goal of this project is to give you hands-on practice with working with the essentials of building a Laravel-based site. In building this project you'll demonstrate an understanding of the following skills:
Creating a new Laravel app.
- Installing and using Composer packages.
- Routing basics.
- Views.
- Deploying a Laravel app on a live server.

Task
- Create a site called Developer's Best Friend which includes a Lorem Ipsum Generator and a Random User Generator.
- Your landing page should include a description of your app with either links to the two tools, or with the two tools present on the page.
- You can collect input via one of two ways:
	- Via the URL (Easier)
		For example, if the user visits http://domain.com/lorem-ipsum/5 they should see 5 paragraphs of lorem ipsum text. If the user visits http://domain.com/user-generator/5 they should see 5 users. If you choose this method, include instructions for your user.
	- Via a Form (Harder)
		Create a form where the user can specify how many paragraphs they want, how many users they want, etc.
- For your lorem ipsum text, use a Package such as badcow/lorem-ipsum. (https://packagist.org/packages/badcow/lorem-ipsum)
- For your random users, use a Package such as fzaninotto/faker. (https://packagist.org/packages/fzaninotto/faker)
- These packages are just suggestions; you're welcome to use others.

http://lipsum.com

http://randomuser.me

Extra Challenges
- Make it look nice.
- Give the option to include extra info for the generated users, such as birthdate, location, a small profile blurb, etc.
- Add your xkcd generator from p1 (not just a linkâ€” actually work the code into your Laravel app).
- Add a new feature: Permissions calculator (inspiration: http://permissions-calculator.org/)
- Include validation for any input.

Misc
- When completed, do not forget to add the link to your project and its Github repository to your P1 Portfolio.
